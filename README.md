# CompreSeed–LLM Hybrid Architecture

CompreSeed is a CPU-based semantic memory and retrieval system designed for Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It performs **zero-decompression semantic search**, stores information as **irreversible compressed semantic cores**,  
and delivers high-speed reasoning without GPUs.  
The system is **hallucination-resistant**, **ransomware-resistant**, and ideal for **hybrid LLM architectures**.  
This repository includes whitepapers, architectural diagrams, and implementation references.

## 💡 Key Features

### 🔸 Zero-Decompression Retrieval  
CompreSeed allows semantic search to run **directly inside the compressed space**, without tokenization, vectorization, or decompression.

### 🔸 Irreversible Semantic Compression  
Documents are transformed into compact semantic cores that **cannot be reconstructed**, even with full access to all indices.

### 🔸 CPU-Only Execution  
The system performs fast reasoning and search entirely on CPU hardware, enabling deployment on laptops, servers, or offline environments.

### 🔸 Hallucination-Resistant LLM Memory  
When used with LLMs, CompreSeed acts as a factual, stable, external semantic memory.

### 🔸 Security by Design  
The SecureSeed variant is resistant to:
- ransomware  
- data theft  
- embedding inversion  
- model checkpoint leakage  
- quantum-assisted reconstruction attacks
